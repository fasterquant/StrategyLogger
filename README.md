# FasterQuant.StrategyLogger
FasterQuant.StrategyLogger utilizes Serilog and provides the ability to easily write structured trading events.  Logger configuration can be handled via a config file which is deployed to the same location as the assembly which makes for a seamless integration with an ATS (Automated Trading System).

Please see the [unit tests](../blob/master/Source/FasterQuant.StrategyLogger.Tests/StrategyLoggerTests.cs) for usage.
